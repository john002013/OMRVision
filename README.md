# OMRVision
Computer Vision–Based Grading System

# Overview
OMRVision is a computer vision–powered grading system built using Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) techniques.
The system automatically scans multiple-choice answer sheets, detects filled answer bubbles, compares them with the correct answers, and produces a final score.
This project demonstrates how AI can automate tasks traditionally done manually, helping teachers, schools, and exam bodies reduce grading errors and save time.

# Purpose of the Project

The primary aim of this OMR system is to automate the evaluation of objective tests using standard or custom-designed OMR sheets.

It is designed to:

1. Reduce manual grading effort

Human checking is slow and error-prone. OMR automates and speeds up the entire process.

2. Increase accuracy in scoring

Computer vision eliminates inconsistencies caused by human graders.

3. Support large-scale exam processing

Perfect for schools, CBT centers, training institutes, and mock exam assessments.

4. Provide instant results

Scores are calculated immediately and can be saved, exported, or displayed in real-time.

# Features

1. Detects and processes scanned or photographed OMR sheets
2. Identifies filled options using thresholding and contour detection
3. Compares detected choices with an answer key
4. Calculates and displays final score
5. Works with custom OMR templates
6. Supports multiple questions and answer formats
7. Option to export results to CSV or PD
8. Lightweight, fast, and easy to modify

# Tech Stack

1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. Custom OMR Template Design
